* Bit more writing on comment reply.  Sent to Alex and Alan for feedback. 

### nonparametric-bayes

Demonstrating robustness of the GP approach is remarkably difficult ironically because the comparison methods are not particularly robust; most often due to poor initial conditions.  Doing all I can to make the MLE and parametric Bayesian cases suitably automated such that the can give reasonable performance as I loop over various simulation parameters and models without much hand-holding of each of the estimators. 

Also an automatic sensitivity analysis gets pretty computationally intensive and generates a lot of different outputs to keep track of, trying to improve this through cleaner code, parallelization, caching, chunk dependencies, and namespaces for scripts. 

* Playing with mcmc convergence over initial conditions
* Running case without measurement error for parametric bayesian models
* Adaptuing runs for parallel and for execution on farm cluster
* Consider ADMB for the MLE estimate to be a bit more robust for automated cases.
