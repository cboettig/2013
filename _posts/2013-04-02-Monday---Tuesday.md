* Came across this rather nice summary of big data in Ecology through some buzz in the twittersphere`r citet("10.1890/120103", "discusses")`.  
* More fishery managment controversy with `r citet("10.1038/nature11975", "discusses")` critiquing the 'ocean food provision index' from Nature last year, and a subset of that team replying `r citet("10.1038/nature11975", "discusses")`. Seems to fall along the usual divisions of whether to use or ignore imperfect data; no doubt the truth lies somewhere in between.  
* Looks like `r citet("10.1890/12-0268.1", "discusses")` have a nice synchrony paper in kelp forests which I'm looking forward to reading.
* Nonlinear forecasting strikes again in PNAS, `r citet("10.1073/pnas.1215506110", "discusses")` Predicting climate effects on sardine with the usual suspects.  May disentangle physical forcing from ecological dynamics.  
* `r citet("10.1073/pnas.1217689110", "discusses")` discuss the classic problem of optimization in conservation: balancing social equity, economic return and conservation needs.   
* ROpenSci is mentioned in a letter to the editor published in Ecotoxicology, `r citep("10.1002/etc.2140", "discusses")`.
