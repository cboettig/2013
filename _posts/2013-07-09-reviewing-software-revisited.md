Summary of Reviewers recommended revisions:
- please provide a list of your recommendations, indicating which are compulsory for acceptance and which are optional but would improve the quality of the paper or the reusability of the software.


The paper
     a. Is the title of the paper descriptive and objective?
     b. Does the Abstract give an indication of the software's functionality, and where it would be used?
     c. Do the keywords enable a reader to search for the software?
     d. Does the Introduction give enough background information to understand the context of the software's development and use?
     e. Does the Implementation and Architecture section give enough information to get an idea of how the software is designed, and any constraints that may be placed on its use?
     f. Does the Quality Control section adequately explain how the software results can be trusted?
     g. Does the Reuse section provide concrete and useful suggestions for reuse of the software, for instance: other potential applications, ways of extending or modifying the software, integration with other software?
     h. Are figures and diagrams used to enhance the description? Are they clear and meaningful?
     i. Do you believe that another researcher could take the software and use it, or take the software and build on it?


 The software
     a. Is the software in a suitable repository? (see http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/about/repositories/ for more information)
     b. Does the software have a suitable open licence? (see http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/faq/#q5 for more information)
     c. If the Archive section is filled out, is the link in the form of a persistent identifier, e.g. a DOI? Can you download the software from this link?
     d. If the Code repository section is filled out, does the identifier link to the appropriate place to download the source code? Can you download the source code from this link?
     e. Is the software license included in the software in the repository? Is it included in the source code?
     f.  Is sample input and output data provided with the software?
     g. Is the code adequately documented? Can a reader understand how to build/deploy/install/run the software, and identify whether the software is operating as expected?
     h. Does the software run on the systems specified? (if you do not have access to a system with the prerequisite requirements, let us know)
     i.  Is it obvious what the support mechanisms for the software are?
