## MBI Workshop


#### Becky Epanchin-Niell

- Motivating example of Rabies spatial control in Switzerland

- 2012 Eco Let: should New Zealand survey for bark beetle? Cost of survellience, control, and damage. `r citet("10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01800.x")` 

- 2012 JEEM spatial spread of star thistle: control spread and eradication as an integer programming problem in deterministic context.  (with Wilen)
`r citet("10.1016/j.jeem.2011.10.003")`

- Breaking landscape into individual landowners makes it less valuable to control early.  


####  Kat Shea

- IDH varying both frequency and intensity. `r citet("10.1073/pnas.1018594108")`, experimental example in `r citet("10.1098/rsbl.2012.0282")`

- Changing of timing matters more than frequency (e.g. hit weed a key phase of life cycle) `r citet("10.1007/s12080-011-0133-1")`.  
- changing autocorrelation of distrubance as a managment strategy 


#### Brian Leung

"Data, uncertainty and risk in biological invasions"

- Alien risk assessments `r citet("10.1111/ele.12003")`, shows a dominance of rank scoring over truely quantitative approaches. Limitations to each.  
- It's not the model complexity, but the implementation interface that poses the real barrier. Also need better integration needs.

Scott Barrett 



### PDG Control 

- back-and-forth with Paul: is second column redundant?
