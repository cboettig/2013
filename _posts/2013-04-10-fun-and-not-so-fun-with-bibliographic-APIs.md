### Crossref API and Faraday

Looking at automating vita entries. The faraday gem looks like a nice general tool for API queries in Ruby (ht Martin Fenner) 

* [Example exploration](https://github.com/cboettig/sandbox/blob/b2351f4bb211d8aff8f87440d7f6064a1ebbde98/ruby-scripts/crossref.rb)

### Mendeley API and omniauth

* Omniauth appears to be a solution for Rails apps only?  Not clear if it can be used in vanilla Ruby.  Still stumped by this case; question on [SO]()


### Bisonomy and its API

* RSS feeds too, e.g. [ <i class="icon-rss"></i> warning-signals](http://www.bibsonomy.org/publrss/user/carl-boettiger/warning-signals)
* [Example exploration](https://github.com/cboettig/sandbox/blob/b2351f4bb211d8aff8f87440d7f6064a1ebbde98/ruby-scripts/bibsonomy.rb)

## Misc Notebook infrastructure 

* Figshare submissions: Undergraduate thesis and JPs,  
* Added vita links to pdfs ([#87](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/87))
* Minor tweaks  

### Github hosting

Migrated hosting to Github servers, see notes in [#48](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/48).
