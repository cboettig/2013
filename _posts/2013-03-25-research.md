## Ropensci

* Pull request for rfigshare

Pull request included changes to files we don't want to change.  To address this, we separate fetch and merge with `--no-commit`.  First, fetch the remote repository:

```bash
git fetch https://github.com/jcolomb/rfigshare master
```

The fetch is at `FETCH_HEAD` as it tells us in the console.  

Now we merge the changes without committing them,

```bash
git merge --no-commit FETCH_HEAD
```

So the changes are all made, but not committed.  We can simply unstage the changes we do not want.  Since we only want one file, lets start by unstaging all commits

```bash
git reset --
```

So all changes are in our working directory as if we had just made them, but not told git to do anything yet.  We can now drop any of the files we did not want to change back to their state at last commit (HEAD), for instance,

```bash
git checkout HEAD inst/examples/tutorial.Rmd
```

while staging the changes to the file we want changed:

```bash
git add R/fs_update.R
```

and finally commit and push the changes.
