## Misc things to work out and write at some date

* Catch up on literature reading (unsorted list in Mendeley).  Get entries into notebook.  
* Write thoughts on selecting links anchor text in the notebook
* knitr script workflow: externalizing chunks, cache and figure prefixes.  
* branching projects and unique repositories
* source code for all manuscripts into repositories 
* clean up directories.  in particular, establish separate prosecutors-fallacy repository
* Comments on workflow: Date-oriented (notebook) vs File-oriented (Github) explanation.  (Or is Github both, via history button, and the notebook just the summary that links to it?)


## ropensci

As per [yesterday's announcement](http://ropensci.org/blog/2013/06/12/sloan/), we are officially funded by a generous grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation!

Today:

* Writing feedback on goals, comments to advisors

### taxize

- My friendly [review](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize_/issues/151) of Scott's taxize [manuscript](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize_/tree/dev_ms/inst/doc) ([pdf](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize_/blob/dev_ms/inst/doc/taxize_withcode_plos.pdf?raw=true))


### ropensci website

Scott has a good question about automatic TOC sidebars.  

Can generate TOC with redcarpet filter, but it grabs all headers.  Unclear how to modify so that it grabs only headers above a certain level.  See [my attempt as an issue in redcarpet repo](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet/issues/267).  Similarly pandoc only provides `--toc` as a compile flag, which does not give us the same control over it's placement in the HTML.  

### misc semantics

* Interesting [example](http://serena.macs.hw.ac.uk/serena/discover-me-semantically/process.php) of RDF visualization and linking to external linked-data resources.  In particular, good use/example of linking to DBpedia information.  See [issue #63](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/issues/63) 

## Misc

* Open peer review on [copernicus platform](http://publications.copernicus.org/services/public_peer_review.html)
* Smith fellows 2014 [applications open](http://www.conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows/apply/proposal-guidelines)



<!-- Text that didn't make it into my post 

## Where to submit

Actually, I don't care.  Almost any journal publishing methodology recieves software papers, which often provides a clear target audience.  For instance, though the [JSS]() is best adapted to publishing papers involving R packages, the editorial board is not one of ecologists or evolutionary biologists, who more frequently publish software papers in [MEE](), [Oxford Bioinformatics]() or [PLoS Bioinformatics]().  The JISC's Journal of Open Research Software ...
