* Added multiple chains, randomized starting points for each chain, and confirming Gelman-Rubin convergence criteron via `autojags`.  
* Some edits to adapt the extraction of posteriors from the multiple chains.  
* Stange behavior in `jags.parallel` [SO/16723036](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16723036), looks like an annoying bug.
* Ah-ha, and now a nice solution to this problem via `do.call`.  

When running on farm, try to remember: (yes it's in the run.sh script already). 

```bash
module load gcc R jags
```

This appears to result in greater uncertainty:

Suggesting the earlier appearance of convergence occurs only thanks to starting conditions close to the optimum?  

## Misc

* Grr, why is `dcast` not more intuitive to me.  Thank you SO folks. [SO/16722117](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16722117)
