My [lab notebook, 2010-2014](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook), was divided out by year in 2015, as described in [this post](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2015/01/01/notebook-maintenance-and-scaling.html). This repository contains the Jekyll source files for notebook entries of 2013 on the master branch, and hosts the output HTML files from its gh-pages branch.  Rendered HTML versions of these can be viewed at http://carlboettiger.info/2013.

To promote long-term preservation and discoverability, the master branch of this respository ([tag:2013-archive](https://github.com/cboettig/2013/releases/tag/2013-archive)) has been permanently archived on Figshare and can be retrieived using the DOI badge above.
